Program a Conway’s automaton, or “Game Of Life” using LISP

## LISP
### functional programming language (Lot of parenthesis XD)
Lisp is an amazing language, really. The swarm of parenthesis might be a little bit difficult to wrap your head around at first, but once you get it, a new world opens.

Its functionnal paradigm, the way “everything” is a list, the way the list are processed, handling data as code and vice versa, etc.

## Game of Life
Game Of Life: is a cellular automaton whose initial input configuration determines its evolution.

The game is played on a virtually infinit grid of cells, each cell beeing either alive or dead. The life or death of a cell is determined by the state of its 8 neighbors according to a set of simple rules.

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by
reproduction.

When first watching a Conway’s automaton unfold, one is mesmerized. Seeing all these little cells live and die, again and again, at high speed while creating complex and seemingly “alive” patterns really reminds of actual living cells.

Things really get weird when one discovers that, through this entertaining chaos, order can emerge. Specific patterns can be used to create complex interractions between blobs of cells, self replication, or message passing for instance.
